# Footballer Demographic Analysis 🧍‍♂️⚽

This project explores the demographic characteristics of professional football players using a large and diverse dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding player profiles based on age, height, weight, nationality, preferred foot, and body type.

> 📊 This is part of a **multi-project series** based on a massive dataset scraped from Transfermarkt and available on Kaggle. Due to the dataset’s diverse nature, this repository focuses specifically on **player demographic analysis**. For other analysis projects I’ve created, please visit the [Footballer-Analysis-Series](https://github.com/ByteBard58/Footballer-Analysis-Series) repository, where I’ve listed all of them.

## 📌 Objective

To examine the physical and national distribution of football players, identifying trends in age, physique, and global representation.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed information on thousands of football players, including personal, physical, and performance-related attributes. For this project, we focus only on demographic-related columns:
- `name`, `full_name`, `birth_date`, `age`
- `height_cm`, `weight_kgs`, `nationality`
- `preferred_foot`, `body_type`

## 🔍 Key Analysis & Visualizations

- Age distribution across all players
- Height vs Weight scatter to reveal body type clusters
- Top 20 most represented nationalities
- Preferred foot usage (Right vs Left)
- Distribution of player body types

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** (pandas, numpy)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
